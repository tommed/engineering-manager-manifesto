## Why Write This Guide?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD002 -->

Like many, as CTO of [Vigilant](https://vigilantapps.com)
I have to wear many 'hats'. We're a small company and so I naturally
take on the role of CTO (strategic) and Engineering Manager (Tactical).

Both roles are incredibly deep and broad, so I wanted to help myself
separate the two by defining the one I find more interesting (this one)
in detail.

The role of Engineering Manager can be split into three core
responsibilities: people, product and process. It's from here we can
discuss the methodologies I've learnt along the way which I hope will
help others beginning their journey in this extremely challenging
but rewarding career.

### Noteworthy

I make no apologies about using Cursor and Generative AI in general to
help me construct this site. There's a lot of knowledge to capture and
we're all busy people - romanising writing everything by hand is like
romanising milking the cow and grinding the oats yourself for your porridge!

Whilst this site begins as a method to articulate a list of concepts I
have written myself, there is no doubt that AI will inspire other
recommendations - those that I agree with will also be included in this site
without a disclaimer.
